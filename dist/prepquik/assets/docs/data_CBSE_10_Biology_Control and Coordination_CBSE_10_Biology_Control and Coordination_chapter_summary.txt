**Control and Coordination**

**Nervous System in Animals**

* **Nervous tissue:** Composed of neurons, which transmit electrical impulses.
* **Neuron:** Consists of a cell body, dendrites (receive impulses), and an axon (transmits impulses).
* **Synapse:** Gap between neurons where chemical signals are transmitted.

**Reflex Actions:**

* Unconscious and involuntary responses to stimuli.
* Involve a reflex arc, a direct pathway from receptor to effector (muscle).

**Voluntary Actions:**

* Conscious and thought-out responses.
* Controlled by the central nervous system: brain and spinal cord.
* Brain: Consists of forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain.
* Forebrain: Responsible for thinking, sensory processing, and motor control.
* Midbrain and hindbrain: Control involuntary actions and maintain balance.

**Chemical Coordination in Plants**

* **Plant hormones:** Chemical messengers that regulate growth and development.
* **Auxin:** Promotes cell elongation, causing movement towards light (phototropism).
* **Gibberellins:** Stimulate stem growth.
* **Cytokinins:** Promote cell division.
* **Abscisic acid:** Inhibits growth and causes wilting.

**Hormonal Coordination in Animals**

* **Endocrine system:** Consists of glands that secrete hormones.
* **Hormones:** Chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream.
* **Adrenaline:** Prepares the body for fight-or-flight response.
* **Thyroxin:** Regulates metabolism and growth.
* **Insulin:** Regulates blood sugar levels.
* **Growth hormone:** Regulates growth and development.
* **Feedback mechanisms:** Regulate hormone secretion levels.
